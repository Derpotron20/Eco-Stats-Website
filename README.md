<h3>What?</h3>
<p>This is a basic webpage that can currently be run as a local server on your computer, or accessed online. It shows the most Economics Statistics that we are currently learning for class.</p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>Option 1: Go to "derpotron20.github.io". This will have the most recent upload of the website that is on github.<br>Option 2: One can also download the folder onto your computer, and then run the python file. If not on a macintosh computer, you are required python to be installed, in this case go to the microsoft stall and install the latest version form there. After doing this, double click the local_server.py file and use python to run it. After going to a web browser you will then need to type in "localhost:8000", and press enter. This will work even if you are not connected to the internet.</p>
<h3>Note!</h3>
<p>Currently it does not automatically update the statistics, after each release of new statistics, the website will be updated and will need to be re-downloaded. A future addition will be to connect the project to an api/webscraper and automatically collect the data. This auto-updating will require an internet connection</p>
<br>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>This is not important to the general use and running of this project, only if you wish to know the motive behind it.</p>
<p>I decided to take on this project as I knew that it would be an interesting and challenging project to learn how the different programming languages iteract with each other and how to build a website that is functional and looks good. I decided on doing this specific topic as I believed it would be important for there to be a way to "quickly" check statistics required in our Economics class without going to multiple different website. If you have any advice for new features or want to ask for an update, email me at "26bragam@student.pac.nsw.edu.au", or post a comment on the github page.</p>
